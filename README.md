# PasswordGenerator

# 03-JavaScript: HW 3 - Password Generator by Abdinajib Liban

## My Task

For my third project, I was asked to create a reposity that contains an application that an employee could use to generate a random password based on criteria that they've selected by modifying starter code. 

## The User Story

```
An employee with access to sensitive data wants to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so that he/she can create a strong password that provides greater security. 
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

## My Result

I created an app that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by Javascript code. It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. The user interface matches the image of the demo that can be found in the assets folder.
